## Experience
### [Simulations for Cucker-Smale-Model and Its Extensions](https://github.com/neulbo-187/Cucker-Smale-Model)
I coded and ran simulations about the Cucker-Smale model, nonlinear ODE system describing the flocking behaviors, and its extensions. Mostly, the works have been done for writing [my master's degree thesis](http://www.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=be54d9b8bc7cdb09&control_no=c40c7fb1b28114ebffe0bdc3ef48d419)(I changed my name from 'Tack Geun' to 'Doeun'). I extended and suggested a model, made indices about energy to prove the theory and proved that there is a condition for flocking by analytic methods. I implemented numerical methods for solving ODE and SDE with NumPy and plotted for showing that numerical results match to theoretical results with matplotlib.

Also, I participated in [a follow-up study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07353) of the thesis. The main achievement is a development of an index for estimating the speed of convergence. I ran simulations and showed that theoretical achievement is also supported by numerical simulations. The article is published in ["Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570422001265?dgcid=coauthor), listed in SCIE and SCOPUS. 

### [Making DB of Playlist with Web Crawling in Python](https://github.com/neulbo-187/making-DB-with-crawling)
I crawled datum of musics in the given playlist, from a music streaming site 'genie.com', and exported DB as xlsx file. It was my first time that making a crawling project from zero, so I learned how to choose a proper site and how to analyze the parsed page.

### [1902 NIMS report](https://github.com/neulbo-187/1902-NIMS-report)
I made 2 programs. The first one is classifing iris data with decision tree and random forest. The second one is suggesting houses and positioning the houses on the map. I became more skillful at using sklearn, Pandas, and Folium through this project. Caused to collisions happened during installing libraries, I learned setting develop environment is so important. 

### Teaching Experience
I had taught 'Engineering Math' classes as TA in Yonsei Univ. for 2 years. The classes covered calculus, linear algebra, solving ODE and PDE, and complex analysis.
