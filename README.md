## Experience
### [Simulations for Cucker-Smale-Model and Its Extensions](https://github.com/neulbo-187/Cucker-Smale-Model)
I did simulations about the Cucker-Smale model, second-order-nonlinear ODEs describing the flocking behaviors, and its extensions. Mostly, the works have been done for writing [my master's degree thesis](http://www.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=be54d9b8bc7cdb09&control_no=c40c7fb1b28114ebffe0bdc3ef48d419)(I changed my name from 'Tack Geun' to 'Doeun'). I extended and suggested a model, made indices about energy to prove the theory and proved that there is a condition for flocking. I implemented numerical methods for solving ODE and SDE with NumPy and plotted for showing that numerical results match to theoretical results with matplotlib.

### [Making DB of Playlist with Web Crawling in Python](https://github.com/neulbo-187/making-DB-with-crawling)
I crawled datum of musics in the given playlist, from a music streaming site 'genie.com', and exported DB as xlsx file. It was my first time that making a crawling project from zero, so I learned how to choose a proper site and how to analyze the parsed page.

### [1902 NIMS report](https://github.com/neulbo-187/1902-NIMS-report)
I made 2 programs. The first one is classifing iris data with decision tree and random forest. The second one is suggesting houses and positioning the houses on the map. I became more skillful at using sklearn, Pandas, and Folium through this project. Caused to collisions happened during installing libraries, I learned setting develop environment is so important. 

### [School Projects](https://github.com/neulbo-187/graduate-course)
#### [Homeworks for the lecture 'Machine Learning 3'](https://github.com/neulbo-187/graduate-course/tree/main/19-1/Machine-Learning-3)
I implemented the first visit Monte-Carlo method and TD for solving the finding optimal route problem. I revised or made a code using NumPy and TensorFlow. Making TensorFlow graph structure and debugging was unfamiliar but it was very interesting. 

#### [Homeworks for the lecture 'Algorithms'](https://github.com/neulbo-187/graduate-course/tree/main/20-1/Algorithms)
We learned some algorithms, e.g. greedy, divide and conquer, e.t.c. , and solved some problems using the algorithms in the spring semester of 2020. The main textbook of the course was 'Introduction to the Design & Analysis of Algorithms'written by Anany Levitin. There are codes for homework in the linked repository. Almost all of them are done with C.

#### [Homeworks for the lecture 'Numerical Analysis'](https://github.com/neulbo-187/graduate-course/tree/main/20-1/Numeical-Analysis/)
We studied numerical methods for solving algebraic and differential equations, interpolation, integration, and optimization. In a repository 'Numerical Analysis', there are codes for homework. They are the implementation of algorithms learned in the class with MATLAB.

### Teaching Experience
I had taught 'Engineering Math' classes as TA in Yonsei Univ. for 2 years. The classes covered calculus, linear algebra, solving ODE and PDE, and complex analysis.
