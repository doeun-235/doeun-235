## Experience
### [Simulations for Cucker-Smale-Model and Its Extensions](https://github.com/neulbo-187/Cucker-Smale-Model)
I did simulations about the Cucker-Smale model, second-order-nonlinear ODEs describing the flocking behaviors, and its extensions. Mostly, the works have been done for writing [my master's degree thesis](http://www.riss.kr/search/detail/DetailView.do?p_mat_type=be54d9b8bc7cdb09&control_no=c40c7fb1b28114ebffe0bdc3ef48d419). I extended and suggested a model, made indices about energy to prove the theory, and proved a theory. I implemented numerical methods for solving ODE and SDE with NumPy and plotted for showing that numerical results match to theoretical results with matplotlib.

### [Making DB of Playlist with Web Crawling in Python](https://github.com/neulbo-187/making-DB-with-crawling)
I crawled datum of musics in the given playlist, from a music streaming site 'genie.com', and exported DB as xlsx file.

### [1902 NIMS report](https://github.com/neulbo-187/1902-NIMS-report)
I made 2 progrmas. The first one is classifing iris data with decision tree and random forest. The second one is suggesting houses and positioning the houses on the map. I became more skillful at using sklearn, Pandas, and Folium through this project.

#### [Homeworks for the lecture 'Machine Learning 3'](https://github.com/neulbo-187/graduate-course/tree/main/19-1/Machine-Learning-3)


#### [Homeworks for the lecture 'Algorithms'](https://github.com/neulbo-187/graduate-course/tree/main/20-1/Algorithms)


#### [Homeworks for the lecture 'Numerical Analysis'](https://github.com/neulbo-187/graduate-course/tree/main/20-1/Numeical-Analysis/)


### Teaching Experience
I had taught 'Engineering Math' classes as TA in Yonsei Univ. for 2 years. The classes covered calculus, linear algebra, solving ODE and PDE, and complex analysis.
